# PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR

# You can override the Apache MPM prefork settings to increase the performance for of the PHP application. In case you set the Cgroup limits in Docker, the image will attempt to automatically set the optimal values. You can override this at any time by specifying the values yourself:

# HTTPD_START_SERVERS=8
# The StartServers directive sets the number of child server processes created on startup.
# Default: 8

# HTTPD_MAX_REQUEST_WORKERS=256

# The MaxRequestWorkers directive sets the limit on the number of simultaneous requests that will be served.
# MaxRequestWorkers was called MaxClients before version httpd 2.3.13.
# Default: 256 (this is automatically tuned by setting Cgroup limits for the container using this formula: TOTAL_MEMORY / 15MB. The 15MB is average size of a single httpd process.
# You can use a custom composer repository mirror URL to download packages instead of the default 'packagist.org':

# COMPOSER_MIRROR
# Adds a custom composer repository mirror URL to composer configuration. Note: This only affects packages listed in composer.json.
